# pyChat
Very simple &amp; lightweight console based chat application implemented in Python 3.6.

After running server.py you can run multiple clients with different usernames which appear next to any message sent. server.py outputs new messages
immediately whereas client.py currently recquires a blank message (hit enter) to refresh the client and update any newly received messages.

Hobby project.
